## IP Stats

IP Stats is an application, that, through SNMP, is supposed to track the following metrics (given an IP Address and a Port):
  - Inbound IP Packets / min
  - Outgoing IP Packets / min
  
All the SNMP shenanigans were done with [SNMP-Native](https://github.com/calmh/node-snmp-native), a node.js package which enables you to use SNMP primitives. In order to display real-time data, I used the [Plotly Streaming API](https://plot.ly/streaming/).
